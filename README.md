# 🎭 AI Sentiment Analysis with PyTorch & Hugging Face Transformers

Welcome to **AI Sentiment Analysis with PyTorch & Hugging Face Transformers** — a beginner-level project where you’ll build a model that classifies movie reviews as **positive** or **negative**.

## 🧩 Course & Project Overview

- **Duration:** 32 minutes  
- **Level:** Beginner  
- **Instructor:** Zhongyu Pan  
- **Release Date:** April 1, 2025  

This project follows along the course by Zhongyu Pan and guides you through:

1. Understanding the theory and real-world use of **sentiment analysis**  
2. Setting up **Hugging Face Transformers** + **PyTorch**  
3. Preprocessing and tokenizing raw text data  
4. Fine-tuning **DistilBERT** using the `Trainer` API  
5. Evaluating model performance via **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**

---

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

- Grasp what sentiment analysis is and where it’s applied  
- Configure and use Hugging Face + PyTorch for NLP tasks  
- Turn raw textual data into tokenized inputs for model training  
- Fine-tune a pre-trained DistilBERT for sentiment classification  
- Use key evaluation metrics to assess your model’s performance

## 📈 Results & Metrics

After training, expect outputs like:

| Metric        | Value  |
| ------------- | ------ |
| **Loss**      | 0.3458 |
| **Accuracy**  | 0.8734 |
| **Precision** | 0.8803 |
| **Recall**    | 0.8644 |
| **F1-Score**  | 0.8723 |

Also consider visualizing a **confusion matrix** to understand where the model errs (false positives vs false negatives).
